# 808 Bass Drum

Some years ago, I bought a PCB online that implements the bass drum circuit from the classic Roland TR808. The PCB is still available to purchase: [https://www.tindie.com/products/jmej/808-kick-drum-clone-pcb/](https://www.tindie.com/products/jmej/808-kick-drum-clone-pcb/).

A thread on Muffwiggler discusses the PCB: [http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54149](http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=54149)

As part of my current modular DIY effort, I decided to finally populate the PCB and turn it into a eurorack module for use in my system. 

As a gentle introduction to PCB design, I designed a simple 'host PCB' to house the hardware (3 x jacks; 4 x pots) and support the main PCB.

## Current status

* Main PCB: fully populated and tested - works.
* Host PCB: Built - works!
* Panel: Installed

## Possible extension

A Muffwiggler user took the same PCB and added voltage control for all the pots. His project "Thumper" is discussed here: [http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=107527](http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=107527)
