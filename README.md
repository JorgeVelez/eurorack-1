# Eurorack projects

This repository contains the results of my attempts to put together a DIY modular synthesiser.

## Modules

Progress so far:

### Braids

Braids is a "macro oscillator" designed by Olivier Gillet of Mutable Instruments. In contrast to the analog VCOs usually used in modular system, Braids uses a software based system under voltage control.

Thanks to Olivier's commitment to open sourcing his designs, all of the hardware and software for Braids is available for use in personal projects.

Full details of Braids is available from Mutable Instruments: [http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids).

### 808 Bass Drum

Some years ago, I bought a PCB online that implements the classic 808 bass drum circuit from the Roland TR808. The PCB is still available to purchase: [http://www.tindie.com/products/jmej/808-kick-drum-clone-pcb/](http://www.tindie.com/products/jmej/808-kick-drum-clone-pcb/).

As part of my current modular DIY effort, I decided to finally populate the PCB and turn it into a eurorack module for use in my system. 

As a gentle introduction to PCB design, I designed a simple 'host PCB' to house the hardware (3 x jacks; 4 x pots) and support the main PCB.

### Buffered Multiple

Every modular system needs a few multiples, and for my 2nd PCB design I decided to make a PCB for a circuit posted on the Muffwiggler forum.

### Ripples

Ripples is another Mutable Instruments module built thanks to Olivier's open source'd designs. It's a 'classic' 4-pole multimode analog filter.

Full details of Ripples is available from Mutable Instruments: [http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/ripples](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/ripples).

## Tools

These are some of the tools I've been using:

### PCB design

I've been using Cadsoft Eagle [http://www.cadsoftusa.com](http://www.cadsoftusa.com) to layout PCBs, mostly because it's free, and because there is a huge amount of information available online to help the novice user get to grips with the software.

For modular synth design, I found the Music Thing Modular part library incredibily useful: [http://github.com/TomWhitwell/MTM-Parts-Library](http://github.com/TomWhitwell/MTM-Parts-Library).

### PCB fabrication

After a little bit of research, I decided to try OSH Park [http://oshpark.com](http://oshpark.com) when the time came to make my first PCB. The results were very successful, so I've stuck with them since.

The downside is that you have to order at least 3 copies of each PCB, but for the sort of thing I've been making the price is still relatively low.

### Panel design

I'm using Inkscape to layout my panels: [http://inkscape.org/en/](http://inkscape.org/en/).

### Panel fabrication

Rather than going for the classic aluminium/steel panel look I decided to go with coloured acrylic panels instead. I am using Ponoko to manufacture these: [http://www.ponoko.com](http://www.ponoko.com)
