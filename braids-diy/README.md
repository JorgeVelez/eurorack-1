# Braids-DIY

Braids is a "macro oscillator" designed by Olivier Gillet of Mutable Instruments. In contrast to the analog VCOs usually used in modular system, Braids uses a software based system under voltage control.

Thanks to Olivier's commitment to open sourcing his designs, all of the hardware and software for Braids is available for use in personal projects.

Full details of Braids is available from Mutable Instruments: [http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids).

## Current status

* PCB: completed and tested 
* Software: uploaded to cpu
* Panel: In progress

## Resources

Given a) the level interest in Mutable Instrument's products and b) the availability of the designs for personal use, there has been a fair amount of interest from the modular community about realising these designs. Here are some resources I've found pretty invaluable:

* [MI Braids Gerbers/ Eagle export?](http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=120940) - Many pages of discussion detailing the journey from Olivier's Eagle files to a working module.
* [Mutable Instrument's Braids open source](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/braids/open) - Information from MI regarding:
    * setting up the toolchain required to compile the firmware
    * compiling the firmware
    * loading the firmware on to the module
* [Mac Tutorial: How to compile and upload the firmware](http://mutable-instruments.net/forum/discussion/4344/mac-tutorial-how-to-compile-and-upload-the-firmware-of-mis-eurorack-modules) - Whilst the main Briads open source page is pretty useful, the real meat-and-potatoes of getting the code compiled and uploaded can be found here.
