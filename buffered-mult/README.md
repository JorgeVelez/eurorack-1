# Buffered Multiple

Every modular system needs a few multiples, and for my 2nd PCB design I decided to make a PCB for a circuit posted on the Muffwiggler forum.

My initial plan was to try and build something comparable to the [Intelijel Buff Mult](http://www.intellijel.com/eurorack-modules/buff-mult/), which is a 2HP-wide implementation. However, after a bit research I saw that Intelijel are using 2 stacked PCBs to manage this width. After a bit of faffing around I realised that I couldn't do something similar as the space required by the 8 jack sockets and hardware to connect the PCBs would exceed the 100mm limit imposed by the free version of Eagle. So on that basis, I am making a 3HP version using a single PCB.
