# Ripples-DIY

Ripples is another Mutable Instruments module built thanks to Olivier's open source'd designs. It's a 'classic' 4-pole multimode analog filter. A full description of the production version of Ripples is available from Mutable Instruments: [http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/ripples](http://mutable-instruments.net/modules/ripples).

Thanks to Olivier's commitment to open sourcing his designs, the hardware design for Ripples is available for use in personal projects via his [git repository](https://github.com/pichenettes).
